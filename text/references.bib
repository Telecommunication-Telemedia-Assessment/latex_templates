TITLE = {Videoconference Fatigue: A Conceptual Analysis},
JOURNAL = {International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health},
VOLUME = {19},
YEAR = {2022},
NUMBER = {4},

ABSTRACT = {Videoconferencing (VC) is a type of online meeting that allows two or more participants from different locations to engage in live multi-directional audio-visual communication and collaboration (e.g., via screen sharing). The COVID-19 pandemic has induced a boom in both private and professional videoconferencing in the early 2020s that elicited controversial public and academic debates about its pros and cons. One main concern has been the phenomenon of videoconference fatigue. The aim of this conceptual review article is to contribute to the conceptual clarification of VC fatigue. We use the popular and succinct label &ldquo;Zoom fatigue&rdquo; interchangeably with the more generic label &ldquo;videoconference fatigue&rdquo; and define it as the experience of fatigue during and/or after a videoconference, regardless of the specific VC system used. We followed a structured eight-phase process of conceptual analysis that led to a conceptual model of VC fatigue with four key causal dimensions: (1) personal factors, (2) organizational factors, (3) technological factors, and (4) environmental factors. We present this 4D model describing the respective dimensions with their sub-dimensions based on theories, available evidence, and media coverage. The 4D-model is meant to help researchers advance empirical research on videoconference fatigue.},

  abstract = {Over the last decades, the interior of cars has been constantly changing. A promising, yet unexplored, modality are large stereoscopic 3D (S3D) dashboards. Replacing the traditional car dashboard with a large display and applying binocular depth cues, such a user interface (UI) could provide novel possibilities for research and industry. In this book, the author introduces a development environment for such a user interface. With it, he performed several driving simulator experiments and shows that S3D can be used across the dashboard to support menu navigation and to highlight elements without impairing driving performance. The author demonstrates that S3D has the potential to promote safe driving when used in combination with virtual agents during conditional automated driving. Further, he present results indicating that S3D navigational cues improve take-over maneuvers in conditional automated vehicles. Finally, investigating the domain of highly automated driving, he studied how users would interact with and manipulate S3D content on such dashboards and present a user-defined gesture set.},
